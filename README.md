## 🚀 Features

## 🚀 Features

- **Efficient Scraping:** Optimized for scraping through sitemaps, ensuring comprehensive and systematic data extraction.
- **Modular Architecture:** Composed of organized modules for HTTP handling, proxy rotation, sitemap parsing, and scraping tasks.
- **Integrated Logging:** Utilizes Logrus for logging, providing insights into the scraping process and aiding in identifying potential issues.
- **Data Export:** Supports exporting scraped data to Excel format, with flexibility in naming the output file using the `-o` flag.
- **(In Progress) Dynamic Content Extraction: Currently enhancing the tool to allow users to specify custom selectors (like class names) for scraping specific content.
- **(Upcoming) Single URL Analysis: Planning to extend functionality to analyze a single URL, extracting and listing all identifiable class names and types of data, and presenting them in an Excel file for comprehensive analysis.

These features are geared toward making `GoScrapeFlow` a versatile tool for web scraping, data analysis, and content aggregation, catering to both specific and broad scraping needs.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ngfenglong/go-scrape-flow.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```sh
    cd go-scrape-flow
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
    ```sh
    go get
    ```

## Proxy Configuration

By default, GoScrapeFlow is configured to use proxy addresses from `proxies.txt`. Here's how you can manage this:

- **Update the Proxy List**: Modify the `proxies.txt` file to include your proxy addresses, one per line.
  
- **Disabling Proxy Usage**: If you're not planning to use any proxy (for reasons like having a VPN or a fast non-proxy connection), you can disable it:
  1. Open the `httpclient/http.go` file.
  2. Locate the `GetRequest` function.
  3. Comment out or remove the line: `refreshClientWithProxy()`.

## 📖 Usage

### Quick Start with Makefile

To build and set up the project, run:

```sh
make all
```

This command builds the `goscrape` binary and sets up the necessary folders.

To run the project:

```sh
make run
```

For development testing with a predefined URL:

```sh
make dev-test
```

### Manual Setup and Run

If you prefer to set up and run without the Makefile:

1. **Build the project:**

    ```sh
    go build -o goscrape .
    chmod +x goscrape
    ```

2. **Create the output folder:**

    ```sh
    mkdir ./output
    ```

3. **Run the project:**

    ```sh
    ./goscrape
    ```

### Cleaning Up

To clean up the generated files:

- To remove the `goscrape` binary:

    ```sh
    make clean
    ```

- To remove the output folder:

    ```sh
    make clean-output
    ```
